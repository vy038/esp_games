# esp_games

Using an OLED display, two buttons, a joystick, a buzzer, and an ESP32, I was able to create a functioning game, in this case replicating Galga and Pong. This was a difficult task to do because, despite making games in the past, it was extremely surface level programming, a stark contrast to having to use a low level language, in this case C++, for a task that is normally for high level languages. I had to learn how to properly use an OLED screen, because despite using it in the past, all I did was use it for text, similar to an LCD, rather than using its full capability of displaying bitmaps. I also learned how to use an ESP32, a more powerful microcontroller with more IO pins than the Arduino. I also documented and made comments under a lot of the code as a kind of “reflection” to see how much I learned and to see if I could explain the entire project, and to also make it look as nice as possible when publishing or giving to someone else. I plan to expand on this project later (e.g. 3D printed holder, other games on it).
I also designed and 3D printed a shell for the game console so it ressembled a retro game console.
