Using an OLED display, two buttons, a joystick, a buzzer, and an ESP32, I created a functioning game, replicating Galga and Pong. This was a difficult task because, despite making games in the past, it was extremely surface-level programming, a stark contrast to having to use a low-level language, in this case, C++, for a task normally for high-level languages. I had to learn how to properly use an OLED screen because despite using it in the past, all I did was use it for text, similar to an LCD, rather than using its full capability of displaying bitmaps. I also learned how to use an ESP32, a more powerful microcontroller with more IO pins than the Arduino. I also documented and made comments under a lot of the code as a kind of “reflection” to see how much I learned to see if I could explain the entire project, and to also make it look as nice as possible when publishing or giving to someone else. I plan to expand on this project later (e.g. 3D printed holder, other games on it).
I also designed and 3D printed a shell for the game console so it resembled a retro game console.
